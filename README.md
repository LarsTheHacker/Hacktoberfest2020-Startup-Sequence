# Hacktoberfest2020-Startup-Sequence
It's Hacktoberfest 2020! Make a startup sequence for the occasion in any language!

Your startup should have certain elements:
-Fun to see
-Creative and Original
-Based on Hacktoberfest, or at the very least mention it
-Not spammy (i.e., please don't just put *print("Start Hacktoberfest")*. If you are a beginner, ask for help!
-Interactive

Criteria for the author to consider viewing your work:
-New file (Your own, not adding to someone else's) in "Hacktoberfest Startups"
-Username submitted with your work (like an artist's signature)
-Code has to actually run in an IDE

Your PRs will be viewed in the order received, please leave us some time to sort through them as they come. :)
